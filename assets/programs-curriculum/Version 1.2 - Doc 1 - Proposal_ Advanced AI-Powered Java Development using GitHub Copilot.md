## **Opening Note – Strengthening an Ongoing Partnership**

We would like to sincerely thank **Agilisys for the continued trust and confidence** placed in **HERE AND NOW AI**.

This engagement marks the **third training initiative** delivered as part of our partnership. Each program has allowed us to go deeper, refine our approach, and align more closely with the real engineering workflows of Agilisys teams.

With this program, we are intentionally **building on that trust** by:

* Increasing curriculum depth  
* Spending more time on real-world engineering scenarios  
* Focusing on higher-order productivity and architectural thinking

This is a **progressive capability-building program**, not an introductory one.

---

## **Program Intent**

This training is designed for **mid-level and senior Java backend engineers** at Agilisys to:

* Use GitHub Copilot as an **engineering accelerator**, not just a coding assistant

* Systematically integrate AI into Java development workflows

* Design and build **AI-enabled Java systems** using LLMs, RAG, and MCP

* Reduce development, debugging, and refactoring effort significantly

* Improve overall **speed, quality, and confidence** in complex Java projects

## 

## **Teaching Philosophy**

The program follows a **workflow-first, engineering-centric approach**:

* Continuous use of GitHub Copilot throughout the program

* Live demonstrations followed by hands-on application

* Realistic enterprise scenarios, not toy examples

* Emphasis on **thinking with AI**, not blindly accepting AI output
